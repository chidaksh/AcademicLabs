####
This folder contains multiple files:

200010046_manager.py is the file which contains the code for the manager
200010046_peer.py has the code for a single peer. 
Peer2.py and Peer3.py has code for other peers to test peer to peer file transfer.
In each peer.py we have list of sharable files and a list of files to be requested from other peers. To use set of different files change the list of files in the code.
File1.txt and File2.txt are the sample files used for peer to peer file transfer demo.
When peers download the files, 200010046_peer.py writes to peer1.txt, peer2.py writes to peer2.txt and peer3.py writes to peer3.txt respectively.
Many error messages will be printed don't get carried away by them when files are downloaded you can view the message <FileName> downloaded by <peerName>.When you disconnect a peer from the network
you can list of downloaded files and updated list of sharable and requesting files.
