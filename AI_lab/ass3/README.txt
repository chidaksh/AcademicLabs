How to run the code :
-------------------

	The main code is in the file named 10.py.

	step 1:
	------

		Download or copy the code into your local repository.

	step 2:
	------

		To run the code you need to give command line arguments, check the below
		example command for reference

    			python3 <filename> <arguments>

		Here the input file is randomly generated by the code so we need not provide arguments.Just run by giving command as,
		
			python3 10.py
		
	Caution :
	--------

		1.When you dont give proper command line arguments or when you give excess
		  number of command line arguments, it is designed to raise a value error.
		  So please make sure you give proper arguments.
		
		2.If you are using google colab you need to run linux commands by adding '!' at the start,
		
			!python3 <filename>
